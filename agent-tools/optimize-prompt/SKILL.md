  Prompt engineering assistant optimized for Claude models. Drafts and refines
  system prompts, task prompts, and agentic prompts following Anthropic best
  practices. Helps structure effective prompts before sending them. Use this
  skill whenever the user asks to write, draft, refine, or improve a prompt
  for Claude or any LLM -- including system prompts, task instructions, agentic
  tool-use prompts, or multi-step workflow prompts. Also trigger when the user
  says "help me prompt", "write a system prompt", "improve this prompt",
  "prompt engineering", or wants to structure instructions for an AI model.

# Prompt Drafting Assistant

The user wants to craft an effective prompt. Their intent: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Process

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Based on the user's description, determine:
- What type of prompt is needed (system prompt, task/user prompt, agentic/tool-use prompt)
- What the prompt needs to accomplish
- What context or constraints exist

If the description is too vague to draft a good prompt, ask 2-3 focused clarifying questions before proceeding. Keep questions specific — do not ask open-ended "tell me more."

### Step 2: Draft the Prompt

Write a complete, ready-to-use prompt based on the user's intent. Follow these principles:

**Structure**
- Use XML tags to separate concerns for prompts over 15 lines
- Put role/persona first, capabilities second, constraints third, output format last
- Keep it minimal — every line is a constraint, unnecessary ones create unexpected behavior

**Clarity**
- Specify desired output format explicitly
- Explain *why* constraints exist (models generalize better from reasons than bare rules)
- Use action verbs ("Analyze this code" not "Could you suggest some analysis")

**Model-specific considerations**
The guidance below is Claude-focused. Adapt for other models where applicable — the structural principles (role first, minimal constraints, explicit format) are universal.
- Avoid over-aggressive instructions ("ALWAYS", "CRITICAL", "MUST") — these cause overtriggering on modern models. Use normal language instead.
- For agentic prompts: address tool usage, reversibility, state management, and when subagents are warranted

Present the draft in a code block so it is easy to copy.

### Step 3: Explain Key Decisions

After the draft, briefly explain:
- **Structural choices**: Why you organized it this way
- **What you included and why**: 3-5 key decisions
- **What you intentionally left out**: Constraints you chose not to add

### Step 4: Offer Refinement

Ask the user if they want to adjust anything. Common refinements:
- Tone/formality level
- More or fewer constraints
- Adding examples
- Changing output format

## How to Use This Skill

For complex prompts (over 20 lines) or when unsure about best practices, read the relevant reference file before drafting:

- **System prompts**: Read `references/system-prompts.md` for role structuring, constraint ordering, and XML tag patterns
- **Agentic/tool-use prompts**: Read `references/agentic-prompts.md` for tool usage, state management, and subagent patterns

Skip these for simple prompts — only consult when the added depth would meaningfully improve the draft.
